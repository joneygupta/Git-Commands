=>1)  What is the difference between GIT and SVN?

The difference between GIT and SVN is

a)      Git is less preferred for handling extremely large files or frequently changing binary files while SVN can handle multiple projects stored in the same repository.
b)      GIT does not support ‘commits’ across multiple branches or tags.  Subversion allows the creation of folders at any location in the repository layout.
c)        Gits are unchangeable, while Subversion allows committers to treat a tag as a branch and to create multiple revisions under a tag root.

=>2) What are the advantages of using GIT?

a)      Data redundancy and replication
b)      High availability
c)       Only one.git directory per repository
d)      Superior disk utilization and network performance
e)      Collaboration friendly
f)       Any sort of projects can use GIT

=>3) Why GIT better than Subversion?

GIT is an open source version control system; it will allow you to run ‘versions’ of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code overtime also it allows you keep the backtrack if necessary and undo those changes.  
Multiple developers can checkout, and upload changes and each change can then be attributed to a specific developer.

=>4) What does commit object contain?

a)      A set of files, representing the state of a project at a given point of time
b)      Reference to parent commit objects
c)       An SHAI name, a 40 character string that uniquely identifies the commit object.

=>5) What is a ‘conflict’ in git?

A ‘conflict’ arises when the commit that has to be merged has some change in one place, and the current commit also has a change at the same place. Git will not be able to predict which change should take precedence.

=>6)  How can conflict in git resolved?

To resolve the conflict in git, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes and then add the resolved files by running “git add” after that to commit the repaired merge,  run “git commit”. 
Git remembers that you are in the middle of a merger, so it sets the parents of the commit correctly.

=>7) What is Subgit? Why to use Subgit?

‘Subgit’ is a tool for a smooth, stress-free SVN to Git migration.  Subgit is a solution for a company -wide migration from SVN to Git that is:

a)      It is much better than git-svn
b)      No requirement to change the infrastructure that is already placed
c)       Allows to use all git and all sub-version features
d)      Provides genuine stress –free migration experience.

=>8) How can you fix a broken commit?

To fix any broken commit, you will use the command “git commit—amend”. 
By running this command, you can fix the broken commit message in the editor.

=>9) Why is it advisable to create an additional commit rather than amending an existing commit?

There are couple of reason

a)      The amend operation will destroy the state that was previously saved in a commit.  If it’s just the commit message being changed then that’s not an issue.  
But if the contents are being amended then chances of eliminating something important remains more.
b)      Abusing “git commit- amend” can cause a small commit to grow and acquire unrelated changes.
